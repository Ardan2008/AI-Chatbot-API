# 🤖 AI Chatbot API

**AI Chatbot API** is an interactive web project that allows users to communicate directly with an artificial intelligence (AI) model in real time through a modern and responsive web interface.  
This application is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **internal JavaScript**, and integrates the **OpenRouter AI API** to generate dynamic, intelligent responses.

## ✨ Key Features
- 💬 **Interactive Chat** — AI responds to every user message quickly and naturally.  
- ⚙️ **Direct API Integration** — Connects seamlessly with the *OpenRouter AI API* without external libraries.  
- 🎨 **Modern & Futuristic Design** — Features *glassmorphism* effects and smooth animations.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The user types a message in the input box.  
2. JavaScript sends the message data to the API using `fetch()`.  
3. The API processes the text and returns a response in JSON format.  
4. The AI’s response is displayed in the chat area using **Marked.js** for clean and styled text rendering.
